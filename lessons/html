        <h3>What is Kinematics?</h3> <p>Kinematics is the study of motion in which we look at how objects travel through certain conditions.</p>
        <h3>Variables Involved in Kinematics</h3> <p>The four main variables used are displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration. Displacement is the change in distance travelled (in m), velocity is the change in displacement over time (in m/s), and acceleration is the change in velocity over time (m/s^2).</p>
        <h3>Kinematic Equations</h3> <p>Altogether, it forms the simple kinematics equations of v = d/t, and a = v/t.</p>

    <div class="Forces">
        <h3>What are Forces?</h3> <p>Forces is the study of how objects can come to term about motion and what is happening to the object. There are many type of forces, but for simplicity we will look at applied forces.</p>
        <h3>How do we Find Force?</h3> <p>This can be through the use of pushing/pulling an object and thus gives us the equation Fnet=ma (F in kg*m/s^2 or N for Newtons).</p>
        <h3>Newton's Laws of Physics</h3> <p>The first law of motion by Newton states that objects can stay at rest or continue to move at a constant velocity. The second law states that if there is a change in forces, there will be acceleration involved in the system. Finally, the third law states that for every action/force applied to another object, there is a reaction force acting on the object.</p>

    <div class="Energy">
        <h3>What is Energy?</h3> <p>Energy is a quantity that allows us to do work which is the change in energy applied to an object.</p>
        <h3>Types of Energy</h3> <p>Kinetic Energy is the energy that is involved in motion. The equation for this is Ek=mv^2 in Joules (J) or kg*m^2/s^2. Gravitational Potential Energy is the energy that is involved when there is a change in height. Due to gravity, the amount of energy that it will hold can change depending on the height. The equation is Eg=mgh in J.</p>
        <h3>Conservation of Energy</h3> <p>The Conservation of Energy is that energy cannot be created or destroyed in our universe. Thus, there has to be conversions of energy in certain scenarios. Say if a ball was dropped from a certain height, then we would need to consider that as the ball is travelling down, there is a conversion of energy from Eg to Ek getting velocity throughout the whole process.</p>
