        <h2>What are Forces?</h2>
        <p>Forces involve the study of how objects interact and move under various conditions. Forces are responsible for changes in an object's motion, and they play a key role in understanding physical phenomena. For simplicity, we will focus on applied forces.</p>
        
        <h2>How do we Find Force?</h2>
        <p>Force can be determined by the equation:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>F<sub>net</sub> = ma</span>
        </div>
        <p>Here, <strong>F<sub>net</sub></strong> represents the net force acting on an object, <strong>m</strong> is the mass of the object (in kilograms), and <strong>a</strong> is the acceleration of the object (in meters per second squared). The unit of force is Newtons (N), where 1 N = 1 kgÂ·m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p>
        
        <h2>Newton's Laws of Physics</h2>
        <p><strong>First Law:</strong> Newton's first law of motion states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will continue moving at a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Second Law:</strong> Newton's second law of motion relates force, mass, and acceleration. It states that the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass, as given by the equation above.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Third Law:</strong> Newton's third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if one object applies a force on another, the second object applies an equal and opposite force back on the first object.</p>
