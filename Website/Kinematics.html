        <h2>What is Kinematics?</h2>
        <p>Kinematics is the study of motion, focusing on how objects move through certain conditions without considering the causes of that motion.</p>
        
        <h2>Variables Involved in Kinematics</h2>
        <p>The four main variables used are displacement, time, velocity, and acceleration. Displacement is the change in distance traveled (in meters), velocity is the change in displacement over time (in meters per second), and acceleration is the change in velocity over time (in meters per second squared).</p>
        
        <h2>Kinematic Equations</h2>
        <p>In kinematics, we use the following equations to describe motion:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>v = Δd / Δt</span>
        </div>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>a = Δv / Δt</span>
        </div>
        <p>Here, the delta symbol (Δ) represents a change in the quantity that follows it. For example, Δd is the change in displacement, Δt is the change in time, and Δv is the change in velocity. These equations are fundamental in understanding how objects move.</p>
