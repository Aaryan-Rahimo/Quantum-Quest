        <h2>What is Kinematics?</h2>
        <p>Kinematics is a branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the causes of that motion, such as forces or energy. It is fundamentally about how objects move in space and time, focusing on parameters like displacement, velocity, and acceleration.</p>
    
        <h2>Key Concepts in Kinematics</h2>
        <p>Kinematics primarily involves the following key concepts:</p>
        <p><strong>Position:</strong> The location of an object at any given point in time. It is usually defined in terms of coordinates in a specified reference frame.</p>
        <p><strong>Displacement:</strong> Displacement refers to the change in position of an object. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction, and it is measured in meters (m).</p>
        <p><strong>Distance:</strong> While displacement is the straight-line path between two points, distance is the total length of the path traveled by the object, regardless of direction.</p>
        <p><strong>Velocity:</strong> Velocity is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. It is also a vector quantity and is measured in meters per second (m/s). Average velocity is computed as the total displacement divided by the total time taken.</p>
        <p><strong>Speed:</strong> Speed is the scalar counterpart of velocity, representing the magnitude of the velocity vector. It is the rate at which an object covers distance and is also measured in meters per second (m/s).</p>
        <p><strong>Acceleration:</strong> Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. It indicates how quickly an object is speeding up or slowing down and is measured in meters per second squared (m/s²).</p>
    
        <h2>Kinematic Equations</h2>
        <p>In kinematics, we use the following equations to describe motion:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>v = Δd / Δt</span>
        </div>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>a = Δv / Δt</span>
        </div>
        <p>Here, the delta symbol (Δ) represents a change in the quantity that follows it. For example, Δd is the change in displacement, Δt is the change in time, and Δv is the change in velocity. These equations are fundamental in understanding how objects move.</p>
