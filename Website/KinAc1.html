      <h2>Displacement and Distance</h2>
      <p>Displacement is the change in position of an object, or how far an object is from its original position. It is a vector quantity, which means it has both magnitude and direction. Distance, on the other hand, is the total length an object has traveled from its original position, or the path it has covered. Unlike displacement, distance is a scalar quantity, meaning it only has magnitude and no direction.</p>

          <p class="figure-caption">Figure 1: Illustration of Distance and Displacement.</p>
      </div>
      <p>In Figure 1, the green dashed line represents the path taken by the object, which is its distance, 
        while the straight black line represents the shortest path from point A to point B, 
        which is its displacement. Even though the distance traveled is longer, 
        the displacement only considers the straight line between the starting and ending points.</p>
      <p>In this activity, we'll be using the distance sensor to explore the displacement of an object. 
        The distance sensor will measure how far an object is from the sensor and output that distance 
        in meters. This will allow us to observe the displacement of the object in real-time.

    <h2>Interactive Activity - Measure Displacement</h2>
    <p>Use the distance sensor to measure the displacement of an object from its starting point. The sensor will provide real-time data on how far the object is from the sensor. This data will be displayed below.</p>
    
    <div class="sensor-display">
        <h3>Sensor Output</h3>
        <p id="distance-value">Displacement: -- meters</p>

        <button onclick="stopActivity()">Stop</button>
        <button onclick="resetActivity()">Reset</button>
    </div>
    
    <p>Note: This activity will demonstrate how displacement is measured in real-time using the HC-SR04 sensor. The distance value will update as you move an object closer or further away from the sensor.</p>
