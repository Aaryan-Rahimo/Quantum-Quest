        <h2>What is Energy?</h2>
        <p>Energy is a quantity that allows us to perform work, which is the change in energy applied to an object.</p>
        
        <h2>Types of Energy</h2>
        <p><strong>Kinetic Energy:</strong> Kinetic energy is the energy associated with an object's motion. It can be calculated using the equation:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>E<sub>k</sub> = Â½ mv<sup>2</sup></span>
        </div>
        <p>Here, <strong>E<sub>k</sub></strong> represents the kinetic energy in Joules (J), <strong>m</strong> is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg), and <strong>v</strong> is the velocity of the object in meters per second (m/s).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Gravitational Potential Energy:</strong> Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its height above the ground. It can be calculated using the equation:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <span>E<sub>g</sub> = mgh</span>
        </div>
        <p>In this equation, <strong>E<sub>g</sub></strong> is the gravitational potential energy in Joules (J), <strong>m</strong> is the mass of the object in kilograms (kg), <strong>g</strong> is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> on Earth), and <strong>h</strong> is the height of the object above the ground in meters (m).</p>
        
        <h2>Conservation of Energy</h2>
        <p>The Conservation of Energy principle states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. For example, when a ball is dropped from a certain height, its gravitational potential energy (<strong>E<sub>g</sub></strong>) is converted into kinetic energy (<strong>E<sub>k</sub></strong>) as it falls, causing the ball to accelerate as it gains velocity.</p>
